# School Normalization Project

This is an open source repository that we've created that makes it possible for people to help normalize university data.

This is very much experimental and we're still ironing out a lot of kinks.


## Todo

- Write this guide.
- Give it a license.
- Create a process around adding schools and managing the repository.
